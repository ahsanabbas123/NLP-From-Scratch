### Basic Sequence to Sequence Learning with Neural Networks
- The most common sequence-to-sequence (seq2seq) models are encoder-decoder models, which commonly use a recurrent neural network (RNN) to encode the source (input) sentence into a single vector. In this notebook, we'll refer to this single vector as a context vector. We can think of the context vector as being an abstract representation of the entire input sentence. This vector is then decoded by a second RNN which learns to output the target (output) sentence by generating it one word at a time.
